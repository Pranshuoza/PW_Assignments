Types of Classification in DBMS
Based on Data Model:

Relational DBMS: Data is organized in tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Hierarchical DBMS: Data follows a tree-like structure (e.g., IBM IMS).
Network DBMS: Data is organized as graphs with nodes and edges (e.g., Integrated Data Store).
NoSQL DBMS: For unstructured data like JSON (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
Based on Users:

Single-user DBMS: Used by a single user at a time (e.g., MS Access).
Multi-user DBMS: Supports multiple users simultaneously (e.g., Oracle).
Based on Architecture:

Centralized DBMS: A single database for the entire organization.
Distributed DBMS: Data is distributed across multiple locations.
Based on Usage:

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Handles real-time queries and transactions.
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Used for data analysis and business intelligence.
