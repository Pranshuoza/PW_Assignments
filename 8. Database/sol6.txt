Data modeling defines how data is organized, stored, and accessed. It creates a blueprint of the database structure.

Types of Data Modeling:
Conceptual Data Modeling: Focuses on high-level design, defining entities and relationships.
Logical Data Modeling: Adds detail to the conceptual model, including attributes and data types.
Physical Data Modeling: Defines how data is physically stored on the storage device.
