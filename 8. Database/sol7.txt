The three-schema architecture divides the database system into three levels:

External Level (View Schema): Represents how end-users interact with the data.
Conceptual Level: Provides a unified view of the entire database, independent of physical storage.
Internal Level (Physical Schema): Describes how data is physically stored on disk.
Advantages of Three-Schema Architecture:
Data Abstraction: Users interact with data without worrying about its physical storage.
Flexibility: Changes in one level don’t affect the others.
Improved Security: User views restrict access to only necessary data.
Simplified Maintenance: Physical changes don’t impact application logic.
