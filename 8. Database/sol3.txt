A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software tool that allows users to create, manage, and interact with databases. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

Need for DBMS:
Eliminating Redundancy: Centralized storage reduces data duplication.
Data Consistency: Changes in data are reflected universally across all applications.
Improved Security: DBMS allows role-based access control to secure data.
Ease of Data Sharing: Applications can access data in a uniform format.
Efficient Query Processing: DBMS optimizes complex data retrieval tasks.
