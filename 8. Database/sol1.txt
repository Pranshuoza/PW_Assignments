A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases allow us to store data systematically and retrieve it efficiently when needed.

We Need a Database because:
Efficient Data Management: Databases allow structured storage and quick retrieval of data.
Data Security: They ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
Data Integrity: They maintain consistency and accuracy of data.
Scalability: Databases can handle growing volumes of data efficiently.
