Challenges of File-Based Systems Tackled by DBMS
Eliminating Redundancy: DBMS uses normalization to remove duplicate data.
Ensuring Consistency: Data is updated in a single, centralized location, ensuring accuracy.
Enhanced Security: Role-based access and encryption ensure only authorized users access data.
Data Sharing: DBMS provides APIs and query languages (like SQL) for easy sharing across applications.
Flexibility and Scalability: DBMS can adapt to changing data needs without requiring significant modifications.
